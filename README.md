A weather website that displays weather and air pollution information for any location using openweathermap API, Python3, Flask, Jinja2, GCP Maps API

Important:
You need an API Key from openweathermap.org in order for this to work.

Requirements: Python3.8 minimum, pip3

1. Create Openweather account.
2. Create API Key
3. Create "creds.py" in root of project.
4. Add ` openweather_api_key = "insert your key" ` in to creds.py.
5. See requirement.txt and use ` pip3 install -r requirements.txt `
6. Run the project by running main.py.

Future Improvements:

- Proper Python docstrings.
- Although it was not the goal, make it mobile friendly.
- Better error handling.

Enjoy :)
