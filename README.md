# prettyweather - in progress

A weather website that displays weather information for any location using OpenWeather API and I'm going to try and make it look pretty :)

Important:
You need an API from openweathermap.org in order for this to work.

1. Create Openweather account.
2. Create API Key
3. Create "creds.py" in root of project.
4. Add "open_weather_api_key = "insert your key"
5. Run the project.

Note: I am allowing my google maps api key to be used for convenience at the moment. It is restricted. You will have to create your own key when the project is complete.
Guide will be included.
